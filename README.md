# üåê Wireless Sensor Network Simulator

A comprehensive simulator for wireless sensor networks implementing proactive distance vector routing protocol. This simulator models dynamic network topology changes, message transmission, and protocol efficiency according to academic networking research standards.

## üéØ What This Simulator Does

This simulator implements the requirements from academic research for wireless sensor networks:
- **Proactive Distance Vector Routing**: Uses distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm for optimal path discovery
- **Dynamic Network Topology**: Simulates real-world link failures and new connections
- **Hello Message Protocol**: Nodes exchange hello messages with neighbors for network discovery
- **Protocol Efficiency Analysis**: Measures data packet ratio vs. control message overhead
- **Weighted Link Delays**: Random delays between 0-1 seconds representing realistic network conditions

## üöÄ Simulation Modes

### 1. üìä **Default Mode** - Static Network Analysis
```bash
python simulation.py
```
**What it does:**
- Creates a fixed network topology with N nodes (default: 15)
- Runs proactive distance vector protocol for route discovery
- Sends hello messages between neighbors
- Simulates random message transmissions
- Measures protocol efficiency (typically 8-12%)

**Example Output:**
```
Network created with 15 nodes
Hello Messages: 84 (35.2%)
Data Packets: 12 (5.0%)
Protocol Efficiency: 8.22%
Success Rate: 100%
```

### 2. ‚ö° **Dynamic Mode** - Real-World Network Simulation
```bash
python simulation.py --dynamic
```
**What it does:**
- Simulates network over multiple time steps (default: 20)
- **Every time step:** Nodes exchange hello messages
- **Random events:** Link failures (p_fail=0.1), new links (p_new=0.1), packet requests (p_request=0.3)
- **Protocol adaptation:** Network reconverges after topology changes

**Example Output:**
```
Time Step 5/20:
- Hello messages exchanged: 45
- Link failure: Node 3-7 disconnected
- Protocol reconverged in 3 iterations
- New packet request: Node 2 ‚Üí Node 8 (SUCCESS)
```

### 3. üî¨ **Evaluation Mode** - Protocol Performance Analysis
```bash
python simulation.py --evaluation
```
**What it does:**
- Tests protocol across multiple random topologies
- Varies parameters (p_request, p_fail, p_new) to stress-test the network
- Generates comprehensive efficiency reports
- Compares network performance metrics

**Example Output:**
```
PROTOCOL EVALUATION REPORT
Topologies tested: 5
Average efficiency: 2.5%
Best topology efficiency: 4.8%
Network resilience score: 8.2/10
```

### 4. üé® **Interactive Mode** - Visual Network Exploration
```bash
python simulation.py --interactive
```
**What it does:**
- All features of default mode PLUS interactive network visualizations
- Real-time network topology graphs
- Visual routing table displays

## üî¨ Understanding the Protocol

### Distance Vector Routing
- **Initialization**: Each node knows only its direct neighbors
- **Convergence**: Nodes exchange routing information until network-wide optimal paths are found
- **Adaptation**: When topology changes, protocol automatically reconverges

### Message Types Tracked
1. **Hello Messages**: Neighbor discovery and maintenance
2. **Topology Messages**: Distance vector exchanges for route discovery  
3. **Route Discovery**: Control packets for path establishment
4. **Data Packets**: Actual payload transmissions

### Protocol Efficiency Formula
```
Efficiency = Data Packets / Total Packets
```
- **Higher efficiency** = More data, less control overhead
- **Typical range**: 5-15% (academic networking standards)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Visualization Issues

If you encounter problems with interactive visualization:

1. **Missing GUI Backend**: 
   ```bash
   # Windows
   pip install tk
   
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   
   # macOS
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

2. **No Visualizations Generated**:
   - Make sure you have at least one of: matplotlib, networkx, or PIL/Pillow installed

### Cross-Platform Issues

- **Windows**: Use semicolons instead of && for command chaining in PowerShell
- **Linux**: Install tkinter with `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- **macOS**: Try PyQt5 as an alternative: `pip install PyQt5`

## ÔøΩ Protocol Evaluation

The simulator includes a comprehensive protocol evaluation mode that analyzes network performance across multiple topologies:

### Scoring Metrics

Each topology is scored based on the following weighted metrics:

- **Efficiency (25%)**: Ratio of data packets to total packets
- **Resilience (20%)**: Network ability to handle topology changes and maintain connectivity
- **Overhead (15%)**: Efficiency of control message usage
- **Routing Quality (20%)**: Quality of routing paths based on average hop count (fewer is better)
- **Delay Factor (10%)**: Quality of paths based on link weights/delays (lower is better)
- **Traffic Balance (10%)**: Balance between data volume and network capacity

### Evaluation Reports

The evaluation mode generates detailed reports in the `output/reports/` directory:
- Topology-by-topology statistics
- Comparative analysis across topologies
- Detailed scoring breakdowns
- Cross-topology metric comparisons

### Running an Evaluation

```bash
# Basic evaluation with default parameters
python simulation.py --evaluation

# Advanced evaluation with custom parameters
python simulation.py --evaluation --topologies=10 --iterations=20 --max-prob=0.5
```

Changes:

Based on your request to improve efficiency while maintaining the requirements from request.txt, I've analyzed the codebase and identified the key issues and opportunities for improvement. Here's what I found:

Current Efficiency Problems
Looking at your evaluation results showing only 1.37% efficiency (69 data packets out of 5,044 total), the main issues are:

1. Excessive Hello Message Frequency
Current Problem: Hello messages are sent every time step to every neighbor

This generates 48.22% of all traffic (2,432 messages).

2. Excessive Route Discovery Overhead
Current Problem: Route discovery happens too frequently

45.26% of traffic (2,283 messages)
Should only happen during initial setup and after topology changes
3. Low Data Transmission Rate
With p_request=0.75 over 100 time steps, you should get ~75 data requests, but only got 69.

Solutions to Improve Efficiency
1. Optimize Hello Message Frequency
File: src/core/evaluation.py (lines 158-164)

Current Code:

Improved Solution:

2. Reduce Route Discovery Overhead
File: src/core/network.py (lines 386+)

Current Issue: Route discovery messages are being overcounted

Solution: Implement incremental route updates instead of full table exchanges:

3. Implement Adaptive Hello Intervals
New Parameter System:

4. Optimize Data Packet Requests
File: src/core/evaluation.py (lines 170-185)
