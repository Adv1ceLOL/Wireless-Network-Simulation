SUMMARY TABLE (TRANSPOSED - TOPOLOGY AS COLUMNS):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric | Topology 1
-------------------
Mean Efficiency      |       0.0154
Mean p_request       |       0.5000
Mean p_fail          |       0.1466
Mean p_new           |       0.0655
Mean Reconnections   |         0.00
Links Removed        |            0
Links Added          |            1
Total Data Messages  |            8
Avg Hops/Message     |         1.00
Avg Delay/Message    |       0.5198

Overall average efficiency: 0.0154

Note on network reconnections:
  The 'Reconnects' column shows how many times the network needed to be
  reconnected after a link failure caused disconnected components.
  This is an important resilience feature of the protocol.

Note on statistics:
  - Links Removed/Added: The total number of links that were removed/added during evaluation
  - Total Data Messages: The total number of data packets transmitted (excluding control messages)
  - Mean Efficiency: The ratio of data packets to total packets (higher is better)
