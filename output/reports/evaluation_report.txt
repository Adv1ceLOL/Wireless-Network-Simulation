TOPOLOGY RANKING (higher score is better):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rank 1: Topology 1 - Score: 0.1931
Rank 2: Topology 2 - Score: 0.1931

Best topology: Topology 1 with score 0.1931

Comprehensive Scoring Formula:
  Score = (0.25 * Efficiency) + (0.20 * Resilience) + (0.15 * Overhead) + 
          (0.20 * Routing Quality) + (0.10 * Delay Factor) + (0.10 * Traffic Balance)
  where:
  - Efficiency: Ratio of data packets to total packets
  - Resilience: Network ability to handle topology changes and maintain connectivity
  - Overhead: Efficiency of control message usage
  - Routing Quality: Quality of routing paths based on average hop count (fewer is better)
  - Delay Factor: Quality of paths based on link weights/delays (lower is better)
  - Traffic Balance: Balance between data volume and network capacity

Detailed Scoring Components for Best Topology:
  - Efficiency:        0.0000 (weight: 0.25)
  - Resilience:        0.9653 (weight: 0.20)
  - Overhead:          0.0000 (weight: 0.15)
  - Routing Quality:   0.0000 (weight: 0.20)
  - Delay Factor:      0.0000 (weight: 0.10)
  - Traffic Balance:   0.0000 (weight: 0.10)

Additional Network Metrics for Best Topology:
  - Link Stability:      0.0000 (ratio of stable links)
  - Messages per Link:   0.00 (data msgs per link event)
  - Network Efficiency:  0.0000 (data/total msgs ratio)
  - Link Changes:        1 (total topology changes)

Cross-Topology Metric Comparison:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric               Best Value   Worst Value  Range        Topology ID 
Efficiency           0.0000       0.0000       0.0000       1           
Link Stability       0.0000       0.0000       0.0000       1           
Messages/Link        0.0000       0.0000       0.0000       1           
Reconnections        0.0000       0.0000       0.0000       1           

Note on network reconnections:
  The 'Reconnects' column shows how many times the network needed to be
  reconnected after a link failure caused disconnected components.
  This is an important resilience feature of the protocol.

Note on statistics:
  - Links Removed/Added: The total number of links that were removed/added during evaluation
  - Total Data Messages: The total number of data packets transmitted (excluding control messages)
  - Mean Efficiency: The ratio of data packets to total packets (higher is better)
